    <h1>Assignement 2</h1>
    <h2>Yigit Sirin</h2>

    <p>As the culmination of my IASC 2P02 course, I have opted to analyze William Shakespeare's timeless masterpiece, Romeo and Juliet. 
    Written in Elizabethan English, this tragic love story follows the unfortunate romance of Romeo and Juliet, two young lovers from warring families. 
    I selected this text for its rich complexity and potential for analysis, making it an ideal choice for this assignment.  </p>

    <p>This graphic depicts the play's timeline from start to finish, with the beginning shown at the bottom and the end at the top.
        As you may have noted, the visuals below depict three powerful words: 
        "Passion, Love, and Devotion." These words are infused with deep emotion and tenderness; they were 
        frequently used by Romeo and Juliet when speaking to each other or when referring to each other in conversations 
        with others. One insight we can make is that the words "passion" and "devotion" were used more sparingly and often 
        more directly towards each other, whereas the word "love" was, in fact, a universal presence throughout the play, as 
        you have observed. However, not only Romeo and Juliet but also other characters in the play uttered the word "love" 
        ountless times, underscoring the central theme of love and its transformative power in the play. Another observation we 
        can make is that the term "devotion" experiences a decline in usage as the play unfolds. This is attributed to the fact 
        that initially, the word is employed to represent fidelity and sincerity, whereas, in the latter sections of the play, 
        it is predominantly utilized to express commitment to love and interpersonal connections, more specifically between the 
        star-crossed lovers, Romeo and Juliet. </p>

    <p>The second visualization of Romeo and Juliet dives into the play's darker aspects, highlighting three words: "Death, Murder, and Poison." 
        While the play's primary focus is the romance between two lovers, it cannot be ignored that ongoing hostility between the families is a recurrent theme, 
        resulting in bloodshed throughout the play. The visualization is flipped compared to the previous one, signifying that the feud between the families 
        intensifies as the story progresses, culminating in a potential war by the play's end. The word "Poison" is used more frequently towards the play's 
        conclusion, indicating that it is employed less as a tool to eliminate enemies and more as a means of suicide, as Romeo poisons himself to be with Juliet 
        in the afterlife. Comparing the two visualizations, it is evident that the play's emphasis is on love and affection rather than death and violence. 
        This is noteworthy because the play is primarily a love story, which should emphasize love rather than bloodshed. When examining the words side by side, 
        we can discern that "Love" and "Passion" hold more weight than "Murder" and "Death," indicating that Shakespeare successfully balanced the love story with 
        the play's darker side. However, "Poison" is a more pertinent term than "Devotion," revealing that loyalty is not a primary trait in the play's setting. 
        Overall, the visualization of "Death, Murder, and Poison" provides a deeper understanding of the play's darker themes, emphasizing the play's balance 
        between love and violence and revealing the play's underlying themes of loyalty and betrayal.

    <p>One modification that would enhance this project is incorporating heart-shaped blocks instead of cubes in the initial visualization. 
        Despite my efforts to transform them with the limited code available in THREE.js, I was unsuccessful and opted to use cubes instead. 
        If it were possible to achieve heart shapes, I would have also included a pulsating animation. In the event that I continue working on this 
        data visualization, I aspire to merge both shapes to aid users in identifying the distinctions more efficiently by building a third scene and going 
        over the resemblances. One final improvement/ addition that I believe would be highly advanced and maybe not quite possible yet. I want to make it so 
        that users can enter their own words on the website. Using artificial intelligence, the website would give you a data visualization for the text and a 
        brief explanation of what information is being portrayed using the input text. </p>

        <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
<!--First paragraph-->
        <p> Every morning, a triangle <span class="clickable" id="first-change">appears</span> at the bottom of the cave wall. This triangle has appeared every morning for as long 
            as the people in the cave have been around. Occasionally, someone spends days, weeks, and even months trying to figure out why it's there, its purpose, and where it comes 
            from. Most have concluded that a triangle appears in the bottom corner of their cave every morning, and no one touches it. Eventually, later in the day, the triangle is gone 
            until the next morning. The triangle has become a small part of their lives that gets looked over.</p>
<!--Second paragraph-->
        <p> For the first time one morning, after the triangle appeared as usual, it <span class="clickable" id="second-change">started changing</span>. The triangle had begun spinning 
            and moving left to right; the triangle was going out one side of the cave wall and reappearing on the other. The people in the cave were frightened by this change as it had 
            never happened before. Some assumed the worst by thinking the end was near; others thought liberation was finally arriving to them. Although shocked and scared by the 
            changes, the people in the cave are in awe of the experience, knowing no other generation has experienced what is happening. However, after days of this pattern, the 
            people in the cave lost hope and continued the way they were, which added to the new movement of The Cryptic Triad. </p>

        <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>   
<!--First paragraph-->          
        <p> The people outside the cave see this blue, glowing orb always in the air next to an octahedron and a cone shape. One day, the octahedron starts to spin, and as it turns, 
            the glowing orb begins to move left and right as if there's a magnetic field pushing it side to side. There is a cone in the air with the orb and octahedron. 
            The glowing orb never gets close to the cone; however, after the orb and octahedron change, 
            <span class="clickable" id="third-change">the cone also begins rotating</span> As if it is some satellite  dish searching for a connection, but the question is, what 
            could it be trying to connect with?</p>
   
    
<!--Second paragraph-->
        <p>The people in the cave always thought there was only one triangle, even when they started seeing a triangle appear on both ends of the wall. They never understood that 
            the glowing orb was the one that was moving; they only saw it as the triangle, which was actually an octahedron moving side to side and magically going out one end and 
            coming back through the other. However, the reality was there were always two objects, an octahedron, and a cone, and neither of them ever moved side to side; it was always 
            the glowing blue orb that would move, making them believe the octahedron was moving. The bright blue orb 
            eventually<span class="clickable" id="fourth-change"> dies and falls </span> like a deflated balloon, killing the triangle in the cave and bringing the octahedron and cone to a halt.</p>
